Initializes or updates a file with key configuration for use with AWS KMS.

Biscuit needs a KMS key in each region that you wish to operate in. Keys
are identified across regions via aliases in the form
"alias/biscuit-{label}".

If keys with those aliases exist, they will be used and the file specified
with the --filename flag will be updated to refer to them.

If the keys do not exist, they (and some associated policies) will be
created by using a built-in CloudFormation stack.

If the keys exist in some regions but not others, you can have the missing
keys created with --create-missing-keys.

The keys have labels that are used to identify them across regions.
The default label is "default". You can specify your own labels if you wish
to use multiple labels within a single account.

The resources created by "kms init" are provisioned with useful default
settings. The CloudFormation stack, the policies attached to the keys, and
your IAM policies can be updated as your needs change without re-running
"kms init". By default, the KMS key will have a policy attached to it that
allows your principal complete control over the key. You can add other users
to the list of "administrators" or "users" by using command line flags.

"kms init" merges the configuration it generates with the existing
configuration from the specified file, if it exists. Thus if you wish to
encrypt the same values under multiple labels, you can do so by running
"kms init" once for each label you wish to use. You can also change
the default algorithm for future secrets by re-running "kms init" with the
same label but a different algorithm choice.
