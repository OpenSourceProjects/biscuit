Edit the KMS Key Policy for a label across regions.

edit-key-policy opens up your favorite editor with the JSON representation
of the KMS Key Policy that is currently set on the KMS keys associated with
a specific label. Changes you make to this file are written back to the keys
in all of the applicable regions.

edit-key-policy will verify that the policies in all of the regions are
the same before allowing you to edit the policy. If they differ, you will
need to resolve the differences manually. If you wish to overwrite all of
the regions with a policy from one of the regions, you may use the
--force-region flag.
